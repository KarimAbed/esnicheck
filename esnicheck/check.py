"""
**ESNICheck** is a Python module (with a web application frontend at
[esnicheck.com](https://esnicheck.com)) that checks if a hostname supports the
Encrypted Server Name Indication (`ESNI`), an extension to `TLSv1.3` that
encrypts the `SNI` field. This module checks if a hostname supports `ESNI` by
checking for `TLSv1.3` support and verifying the `ESNI` key published on its
`_esni` `TXT` record. It supports drafts 01 and 02 of the `ESNI`
[RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-esni-02).

The assumption as of this release is that if a hostname supports the `TLSv1.3`
protocol, publishes a valid `ESNI` key (for versions 01 and 02 of the draft;
the current versions supported by Firefox and CloudFlare), then that hostname
supports `ESNI`. The current version of the module does not try to establish a
connection with the server using the `encrypted_server_name` field in the
`ClientHello` to further confirm `ESNI` support but there are plans to add it
in a future release.

If you are not familiar with `ESNI`, please start by reading this [simple
introduction from
EFF](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/09/esni-privacy-protecting-upgrade-https)
or [the post by CloudFlare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/esni/).
